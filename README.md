## Linux Information 

- [Documentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17LW4ExkG6xVFnusVBMaDMA08kmZfyHiPbi8vjLpmLAs/edit) (Mirror PDF is in the repo.)
- Working on a PI3 + Waveshare SX1262 [Amazon Link](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C61VK6WQ)

Two working distros I've tested:
- Ubuntu Server LTS 22.04
- Raspbian 64 bit Bookworm (Note if you select PI3, bookworm will not show on the RPI imager, select no model instead and you can see it and flash like normal. Bookworm works without issue.)

### Bookworm Notes
```bash
sudo raspi-config
```

Enable I2C + SPI + Serial Port.

We like to cause problems and run bleeding edge, mainly because I'm looking for web UI support on the PI. 

```bash
wget https://nightly.link/meshtastic/firmware/workflows/main_matrix/master/artifact-deb.zip
```

```bash
unzip artifact-deb.zip
sudo apt install ./meshtasticd_2.*
```

The package does not seem to specify the need for libulfius.so but is also required,
```
meshtasticd: error while loading shared libraries: libulfius.so.2.7: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
```
```
sudo apt-get install libulfius-dev
```

Standalone start command:

```bash
sudo meshtasticd -d /home/pi/
```

Master meshtasticd configuration directory:

```bash
/etc/meshtasticd/config.yaml
```

Managing via CLI:

```bash
pip3 install --upgrade pytap2 --break-system-packages
pip3 install --upgrade meshtastic --break-system-packages
```

Ensure to use `--host localhost` on all commands. For example:

```bash
meshtastic --host localhost --nodes
```
